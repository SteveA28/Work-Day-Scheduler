# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

In this challenge, I added new time blocks and changed to their respective colors. Then I worked on the script file adding codes to display the current date at the top of the page as well as adding a save event function of what ever is typed in the time block that saves to the local storage.

## Installation

I used visual studio code to create this code in a script.js file, index.html file.

## Usage
